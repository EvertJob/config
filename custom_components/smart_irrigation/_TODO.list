General:
    add some sort of automation / irrigate every X days counter?

    hOW TO Listen to unit changes from HA?
        Was unable to make that work.
Wishlist:
- calculation algorithm: PyEto / PenMon /  ET_calc. See: https://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/HAsmartirrigation/issues/127
- scheduler? or just use something like https://github.com/rgc99/irrigation_unlimited?
